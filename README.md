# .github
Solve 3D physics puzzles by guiding fluids and beams through gravity-defying levels. Place and rotate gadgets—reflectors, bumpers, funnels, accelerators, gates, and teleports—to build reliable routes from emitters to containers. Multiple solutions, smooth camera controls, and optimization goals deliver hours of creative tinkering on Apple Silicon
