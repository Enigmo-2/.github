## 🎮 What is Enigmo 2?

**Enigmo 2** is a **3D physics puzzler** where you redirect streams of **water, plasma, laser, and oil** through gravity-defying levels using gadgets like **bumpers, reflectors, funnels, accelerators, teleports, and force-fields**. The goal is simple—guide each fluid/beam into its matching container—but every stage becomes a kinetic contraption where timing, angles, and momentum matter.

Unlike flat, grid-bound puzzle games, Enigmo 2 embraces full **XYZ space**. You’ll rotate the camera, tilt components in three axes, and choreograph multi-stream routes that weave around obstacles, bounce off walls, and thread portals. Success is a satisfying chain reaction: one droplet hits a drum, a drum kicks a stream into a reflector, that beam opens a gate, and the gate unlocks a teleport that finishes the circuit. It’s part logic, part Rube Goldberg dream.

## ℹ️ About the Game (Expanded)

Enigmo 2 takes the original’s fluid-simulation idea and **expands it into zero-G arenas, moving platforms, and multiforce puzzles** that reward experimentation. Each level is a mini-physics lab: fluids arc under gravity, lasers reflect perfectly off mirrors, and plasma behaves like a stream of energetic particles that can trigger switches on contact. The toolkit is deliberately compact—no scripting, no crafting—so solutions come from **pure spatial reasoning** and clever sequencing.

The design encourages **multiple solutions**. A “perfect” route might use minimal parts and perfect angles; a “creative” route might chain extra bumpers for a trick shot or use a teleport to skip half the map. Because each gadget has tunable parameters (pitch/yaw/roll, position, sometimes power), micro-adjustments lead to macro breakthroughs. That “one degree more” moment is the heart of Enigmo’s appeal.

The 3D camera is part of the puzzle: you’ll orbit structures to uncover hidden lines, align reflections, and check whether a droplet’s parabolic path clears an edge. Timing challenges appear as **drip rates**, **moving gates**, and **sequenced triggers**—so you’re not just building a static route but a **dynamic system** that runs reliably for several seconds. Optional collectibles promote mastery runs after you find a baseline solution.

Performance is tuned for modern macOS. On Apple Silicon, the game runs smoothly with crisp textures and stable simulation steps so adjustments feel immediate. Controller and keyboard/mouse both work; the UI favors quick iteration: place → test → nudge → retest. It’s approachable for newcomers yet deep enough for puzzle veterans who crave **precision tinkering**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Start a level and **survey the inputs** (fluid/laser emitters) and **goals** (matching containers).  
2. Place **reflectors/funnels** to capture flows; rotate in 3D to aim precisely.  
3. Use **bumpers/accelerators** to clear gaps or climb height.  
4. Add **teleports/gates** to bridge impossible spans or sequence flows.  
5. **Test frequently**, making small angle tweaks until streams run reliably.

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

- Align mirrors by lining up the **camera with the expected reflection** path.  
- Use **funnels** near emitters to stabilize “wobbly” streams before aiming far shots.  
- **Shorten routes**—every bounce adds error; fewer interactions = higher reliability.  
- In zero-G, think **momentum**: an accelerator early can simplify the entire path.  
- Stuck? Work **backward** from the goal to the nearest stable intermediate point.

## ❓ FAQ

**Is it kid-friendly?**  
Yes—no violence, just physics and logic. Later levels get challenging but remain fair.

**Controller support?**  
Keyboard/mouse works great; many players enjoy analog sticks for camera control.

**Timed levels?**  
Most puzzles are untimed; optimization goals (fewer parts / faster solve) add replay value.

**Multiple profiles?**  
Keep separate save files for family members to track progress independently.
